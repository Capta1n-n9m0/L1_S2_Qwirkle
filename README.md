##Qwirkle project
It is a project that I will need for my "Algorithms and Data Structures" course.
Project is being written in CLion, on Windows, but will be tested in WSL and Ubuntu. I use mingw compiler in Windows and gcc in Linux and CMake in both to build the project.<br>
I need to bring it up to "engineer" level by May 27th.
