# Qwirkle project

It is a project that I will need for my "Algorithms and Data Structures" course.

Project is being written in CLion, on Windows, but will be tested in WSL and Ubuntu. 

I use mingw compiler in Windows and gcc in Linux and CMake in both to build the project.

I need to bring it up to "engineer" level by May 27th.

I succeeded, but quickly forgot about the project. I may carry on working on it soon. I would love to bring it to online multiplayer level.
