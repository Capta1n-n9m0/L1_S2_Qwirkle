#Development diary.
Here I am writing everything I am adding to the project. Or just provide more description for commits.

### 22-05-21
Today, almost at midnight, I decided to start this project. I will work on it a lot till May 27th.<br>
First I decided to write main function. It will process arguments and store few helper functions.
